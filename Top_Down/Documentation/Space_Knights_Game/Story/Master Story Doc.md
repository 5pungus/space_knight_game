## High-Level Story/Theme Overview

Set in a fantastical universe where goblins, knights, dragons, elves, and other mythical beings coexist, this narrative unfolds in the year 4000 AD. In this universe, the Knights Templar were never disbanded and have continued their mission to protect the members of Christendom. As Christendom expands into space, the Templars are faced with new challenges as they safeguard colonists from various existential threats.

### Key Threats

- **Goblins:**
  - Historically enemies of the Templars since the Middle Ages, goblins were a significant adversary during the Crusades. Their hostility has persisted, now manifesting in space as they oppose the Templars' efforts to protect humanityâ€™s expansion.

- **Freemasons:**
  - This secret society seeks to overthrow the Knights Templar and disrupt Christendom's order. Their covert operations aim to create chaos and undermine the Templars' protective role, posing a significant threat to the stability of Christendom.

- **Dragon Cultists:**
  - These fanatics worship dragons, which have long been extinct. Through gene-splicing procedures, the most devout of their ranks or the unfortunate prisoners have become human/dragon hybrids. Their motives are driven by a desperate quest to locate and revive the last remaining dragon, which they believe holds immense power.

- **Bandits:**
  - Space bandits are a common menace, and their existence is self-explanatory. They pose a threat to colonists by engaging in theft and piracy, further complicating the Templars' mission.

### Main Storyline

The central conflict revolves around the Dragon Cultists, who pose the greatest threat to Christendom. They have potentially discovered the location of an ancient dragon, the last of its kind. This dragon is believed to hold unparalleled power, making the cultists' mission to find and revive it a critical danger that the Templars must thwart to ensure the safety of humanity's expansion into space.
